**Game OVER Screen Development**

**29 July 2021 -- Game Over First Light**

The Game Over Screen fires up after the mothership pushes the players' guns off the screen.  After about a week of munging about this is the first iteration of the Game Over animation where all the characters of the Game Over message end up displayed when the animation completes. 

The animation to put the characters on the screen is trying to run, but things are not going correctly.  Several characters on the right side of the screen do not end in the correct state/color version of the character.   (Odd that they are the correct characters, though.)

**31 July 2021 -- Game Over**

Gave up on clever animation for the characters on the Game Over screen as this was just taking too much time.    For now making myslef be happy with the color transistions.

The complete game cycle appears to be functioning stably.
