**Game OVER Screen Development**

**29 July 2021 -- Game Over First Light**

[![V17 WIP](https://github.com/kenjennings/Atari-1nvader/raw/master/pics/17-WIP-GameOverFirstLight.png)](https://github.com/kenjennings/Atari-1nvader/blob/master/README.md)

The Game Over Screen fires up after the mothership pushes the players' guns off the screen.  This is the first iteration where all the characters of the Game Over message are displayed.

The animation to put the characters on the screen does is trying to run, but things are not going correctly.  Several characters on the right side of the screen do not end in the correct state/color version of the character.   (Odd that they are the correct characters, though.)
